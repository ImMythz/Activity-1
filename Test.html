      This is me writing a short paragraph about myself. I'm not sure what to write about so as I'm just typing words. These words are strung together by periods and commas, as this one is. I need to write one more sentence to finish this paragraph out.

        This is the second paragraph. Congrats to you if you have made it this far into reading. The sentences do make sense but there is no subject. The plot makes no sense either and I'm describing nothing. This is the part where it ends. Thanks for reading. Enjoy the links below.
